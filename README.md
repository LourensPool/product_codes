# Application which visually explains product codes (Individual project)
When streaming digital information over a non-digital medium, errors can be introduced; for example when reading a CD or making a phone call.

This app visually shows how such errors can be introduced and (partially or fully) corrected at the receiving party. The app-user can play around and introduce errors. Errors are (partially or fully) corrected by pressing the buttons 'Decode row' and 'Decode columnn'.
